      "content": "The overload relay is a protection device used in the compressor circuit on your refrigerator. Power is applied to the compressor motor windings through the overload device, and the relay is used to add the start winding in the circuit until the compressor is at running speed. If the fans are running and your compressor won\u2019t start or if you hear a clicking sound from the unit, check the overload relay for signs of overheating or arcing.\n\nHow to test a refrigerator\u2019s overload or relay-start capacitor with a multi-meter:\n\nBegin by ensuring you have unplugged your refrigerator, and then remove the rear panel. Locate and remove your overload or relay-start capacitor. On modern refrigerators the overload relay is usually a combined part and plugs directly onto the side of the compressor. There may also be a start capacitor attached to the relay overload assembly, which provides increased starting voltage to the compressor windings. To test, begin by discharging the capacitor, then set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes onto the terminals of the overload capacitor and/or the relay-start capacitor. The reading you should receive will vary from model to model, and may be indicated on the outside of the capacitor, or in your owner\u2019s manual. If your test does not produce the reading the manufacturer recommends, you need a replacement overload or relay-start capacitor . If your tests do produce the recommended readings you may have a defective compressor, which will need to be tested by a qualified professional as it is a live circuit test.\n\n",

Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, set your control to the lowest (warmest) setting, and place the probes on the terminals. You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading of infinity. With the probes still on the terminals, adjust the control to higher (colder) and higher settings, your reading should then change to zero, indicating that you have continuity. If your control fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement cold control & temperature control .\n\n",
