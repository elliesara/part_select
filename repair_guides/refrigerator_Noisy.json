      "content": "Most modern frost-free refrigerators will have a fan cooled condenser coil. The condenser fan circulates air through the condenser coil to remove heat as well as circulating air over the drain pan to evaporate the defrost water. If your fridge is making a loud noise, the condenser fan motor could be to blame. The condenser fan motor runs at the same time as the evaporator motor and the compressor. In addition to noise, your fridge might not be staying as cool as normal and/or may be turning on and off regularly.\n\nHow to inspect a refrigerator condenser fan motor:\n\nDisconnect your refrigerator from the power source and then remove the rear access panel. Locate the condenser fan motor, it is usually found near the compressor at the bottom rear of the refrigerator. Visually inspect the condenser fan motor for any signs of wear or damage. Look for any debris or obstructions that could be preventing the fan from moving freely. If the fan motor is seized or worn, you will need a replacement condenser fan motor .\n\n",
