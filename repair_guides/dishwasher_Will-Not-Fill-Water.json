The valve will be located behind the lower access panel and will have two wires attached to it, an outlet hose to the tub and a hot water inlet from the household supply. If your dishwasher does not fill, then you should first check the inlet supply to verify that you have enough water pressure.\n\nHow to inspect a dishwasher water inlet valve:\n\nUnplug your dishwasher and disconnect the water supply before starting. Locate your water inlet valve. It is commonly found on the lower left side of your dishwasher. You likely will need to remove the lower access panel to locate it. Looking for any signs of damage, wear, or cracking, visually inspect the water inlet valve. If your valve shows signs of any of the symptoms described above, you will need a replacement water inlet valve .\n\n",

Begin by opening your dishwasher door and removing the cover over the float assembly. Once you\u2019ve done that, manually lift the float and let it drop multiple times, it should move freely, if it does not, remove the float to remove any foreign objects in the guide tube.
