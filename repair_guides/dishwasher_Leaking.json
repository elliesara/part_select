The function of the pump is to circulate water in the dishwasher and in some models, to drain the water as well. The pump typically consists of two separate compartments; one for wash or circulation and the other for draining. The circulation part of the pump will typically consist of the wash impeller and the filter components while the drain portion will consist of a drain impeller and a chopper blade or in some cases, a solenoid operated diverter.\n\nHow to test a dishwasher pump with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect the power from your appliance before beginning. On most models, the pump will be found behind the lower access panel. Locate and remove your dishwasher pump in order to test it. To test for continuity, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the terminals with the probes. This test should produce a reading of exactly or nearly zero. You should also check the ground connection of the pump. To do this, leave one probe on the terminal and touch the other to the bare metal housing of the pump. This test should not produce any reading. If your readings differ from the results above, you will need a replacement pump .\n\n",

Most spray arms are made of plastic which can crack or warp enough to change the spray pattern significantly. Metal spray arms can become damaged or separate at the seams which can also alter the spray pattern. These conditions can cause water to be directed at the bottom of the door where there is no gasket and therefore creating a water leak.\n\nHow to inspect dishwasher spray arms:\n\nWhile not crucial, we recommend you unplug your dishwasher before starting this inspection. Begin by inspecting the arms for any signs of cracking, wear, or any other damage. Next, manually spin the spray arms. You should be feeling to see if there is any resistance, if they are wobbling, or if they hit the dish racks.
