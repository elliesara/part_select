      "content": "The defrost timer can be either a mechanical timer or an electronic \"adaptive defrost control\". Both are used to initiate the defrost cycle by turning on the defrost heater at specific intervals and for a specific amount of time. Mechanical timers are more common and usually activate a defrost cycle every 8-10 hours of compressor run time. This normally occurs about once every day or two. The defrost cycle will normally terminate after 20 to 30 minutes and the compressor and fans will start again. Adaptive defrost controls will monitor ambient conditions and previous defrost cycles and adapt the defrost cycle frequency and length to be more efficient.\n\nHow to test a refrigerator defrost timer with a multi-meter:\n\nUnplug your refrigerator before beginning. Locate & remove the defrost timer from the appliance in order to test it. It can be found behind the refrigerator's lower kickplate, in the refrigerator's control panel, or even behind the refrigerator on its back wall. Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch one probe to the common terminal (it should be labeled \"3\" or \"C\"). One at a time, touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity. If you receive different readings, you will need a replacement defrost timer .\n\n",

The thermostat is normally wired in series with the defrost element and is normally open circuit above 35\u00b0- 47\u00b0 Fahrenheit. For this reason it is sometimes difficult to check the continuity of the thermostat unless you are sure that the temperature is low enough to close the circuit. Newer style thermostats may have an internal bias resistor to aid in testing both the thermostat and the heater. The wiring diagram will normally indicate this.\n\nHow to test a refrigerator\u2019s defrost thermostat with a multi-meter:\n\nBecause you will be testing electrical components, ensure you have disconnected your appliance from the power source before beginning. Locate and remove the defrost thermostat in order to test it. In freezer-on-top models, it may be located under the floor of the unit, or it could be found at the back of the freezer. If you have a side-by-side refrigerator, the defrost thermostat is found at the back of the freezer side. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way, such as the contents of the freezer, freezer shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel. With your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to a thermostat wire. When your thermostat is cold, it should produce a reading of zero on your multi-meter. If it is warm (anywhere from forty to ninety degrees Fahrenheit), then this test should produce a reading of infinity. If your tests produce different results, then you will need a replacement defrost thermostat .\n\n",
