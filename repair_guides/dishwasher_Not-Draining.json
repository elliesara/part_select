Locate and remove your dishwasher pump. It likely will be found behind the lower access panel. Once you have removed it, using a multimeter on Rx1 mode, touch the pump\u2019s terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero.

Your timer will likely be found either in the control panel or behind the lower kickplate. Locate and remove your appliance\u2019s timer in order to test it. If your model has multiple sets of contacts/wires, you will need to refer to your owner\u2019s manual to determine which sets to test. Remove the timer from your appliance, set your multimeter to Rx1000, and touch the contacts/wires with the probes.
