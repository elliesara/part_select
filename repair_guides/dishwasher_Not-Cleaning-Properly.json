      "content": "Dishwashers need adequate hot water to properly clean the dishes, usually about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The heating element, found at the bottom of the dishwasher is used to maintain the temperature of the water in the dishwasher, or to heat the water higher than normal for certain cycles depending on the cycle option selected. It is important to note that the heating element is not used to heat the water for normal wash cycles, so before checking the heating element, ensure that the water entering your dishwasher is hot enough. Please note that water hotter than 140-150 degrees is not recommended as damage to your dishes can occur with very hot water. Before starting a washing cycle, run the hot water in your sink for a few minutes. If hot water is going into your dishwasher, but the water temperature falls during the cycle even with a heating option selected, then you may need to replace the heating element.\n\nHow to test the heating element in a dishwasher with a multimeter:\n\nBegin by disconnecting your appliance from the power source. Locate your heating element, it will be found on the bottom of the tub and depending on your model, it may have a cover. If it does have a cover, remove it. Remove the lower access panel and disconnect wires attached to the heating element\u2019s terminals that protrude through the base of the dishwasher. Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. The reading of a functional heating element varies between models but will fall between zero and infinity, refer to your owner\u2019s manual to determine what reading you should receive. If your reading is exactly zero or infinity, it is defective. If your heating element\u2019s reading is outside the manufacturer\u2019s recommended range, you will need a replacement heating element .\n\n",

      "content": "In a dishwasher there are two impellers, the wash impeller and the drain impeller located within the dishwasher\u2019s pump. The wash impeller is the part that circulates the water and pressurizes the spray arms. The drain impeller, if used on your model, is used only to drain the dishwasher.\n\nHow to inspect dishwasher pump impellers:\n\nDisconnect the power source from your dishwasher before starting this inspection. The pump impellers will be found attached to the pump/motor. Depending on your model, you will need to remove all or some of the following parts to access the impellers: lower access panel, spray arm, pump housing, & screen. Once you have access to them, remove the impellers to closely inspect them. Visually inspect your impellers for any signs of cracking, wear, damage, or discoloration. Additionally, ensure that there are no debris preventing them from moving freely when in place. If you find any issues while performing the checks above, you will need replacement impellers .\n\n",
