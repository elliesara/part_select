The door latch assembly is used to hold the door closed during the cycle to prevent water from leaking and it also incorporates the door latch switches that supply power to the dishwasher controls. If the door cannot close properly to activate the door latch switches or if the switches are defective, then the dishwasher controls will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. Inspect the latch assembly including the switches.\n\nHow to test a dishwasher door latch assembly with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning. Begin by removing the inner door panel to gain access to the door latch assembly. It is usually found at the top of the door. Once you have located it, verify that the door catch activates the door latch switches by inserting the catch into the assembly. If the switches are being activated mechanically, remove the switches to check them for continuity. Using a multimeter on Rx1, touch the probes to the switch\u2019s terminals. This should produce a reading of zero or nearly zero. If you receive a different reading, you will need a replacement door latch assembly .\n\n",

      "content": "If you have determined that the door latch assembly is operating properly and your dishwasher still won\u2019t start, the next step would be to look at the timer or electronic control. The first step of the dishwasher cycle is normally a drain function to remove any standing water in the tub. If you do not hear the drain pump motor running, then you should look at the timer or electronic control as a possible cause. On manual timer models, the timer is used to supply power to the pump motor, water inlet valve, heater circuit and drain pump motor at the proper sequence in the cycle. The timer uses a series of electrical contacts that are driven by a small motor all of which are encased in the timer housing.\n\nHow to test a dishwasher timer with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect your appliance from the power source. Locate and remove the timer. It will most likely be found in the control panel, but it is also often found behind the lower kick plate. Some timers may have multiple sets of contacts/wires, if this is true for your model, you will need to refer to your wiring diagram to determine which contacts to test. Set your multimeter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes. Most functioning timers will fall in the range of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies between models. Refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce. If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you will need a replacement timer .\n\n",
