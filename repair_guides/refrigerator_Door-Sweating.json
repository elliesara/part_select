Damaged gaskets can also prevent doors from closing properly and may introduce enough moisture into the refrigerator that defrost issues may occur. Moisture along the edge of the door is a good indication that the gaskets are not sealing properly and should be replaced.\n\nHow to inspect refrigerator door gaskets:\n\nTake a piece of paper, and place it at various points along the door. Close the door normally and slide the paper out. If the paper slides out without any resistance, then you will need replacement fresh food & freezer door gasket(s) .\n\n",

The door or flapper is normally spring loaded and will have a vinyl or foam rubber seal attached to prevent room air from entering the refrigerator. If there is moisture around the front of the dispenser or if there is signs of moisture in the ice bin area, then this would indicate that the door is not closing completely. The flapper door is hinged and is normally operated by a solenoid with a return spring and often with a damper to slow the closing action to prevent the door from closing on an ice cube.\n\nHow to inspect a refrigerator dispenser door assembly or flapper & ice door kit:\n\nRemove the dispenser cover in order to inspect its components. You should inspect the following parts for damage or wear. Door hinges. Door seal. Door pivot mechanism. Return spring. Solenoid plunger and linkage. Damper. If you find any issues while checking the above parts, you may need a replacement dispenser door assembly or flapper & ice door kit .\n\n",

      "content": "In some models of side-by-side refrigerators, closer cams on the lower door hinges are used to assist in closing the doors. The cams are made of hard plastic or nylon and have sloped shoulders on them that mate together. One cam is mounted to the bottom of the door and the other is mounted to the top of the hinge. When the door is opened, the door cam rotates up out of the hinge cam, lifting the door up and a detent allows it to stay in an open position. When closing the door, the weight of the door forces the door to pivot closed as the cams mate together. If either of these cams is broken, then the door may not close tightly. This would allow warm outside air to enter the refrigerator and cause condensation to form.\n\nHow to inspect your refrigerator\u2019s door closure cam kit:\n\nOpen your refrigerator door and locate the closer cams. Visually inspect the closer cams to verify that they are not cracked, worn, or otherwise damaged. If they are damaged, you will need a replacement closure cam kit .\n\n",
