To test the heating element, first, make sure that power to your dishwasher is turned off, and then check for continuity with a multi-meter.\n\nHow to test the heating element in a dishwasher with a multimeter:\n\nUnplug your dishwasher before attempting this test. Your heating element will be found inside the dishwasher, attached to the bottom of the tub. It may be covered or uncovered. If it is covered, remove the cover. In order to disconnect the heating element, you will need to remove the lower access panel. Remove the wires attached to the heating element\u2019s terminals by carefully grasping the metal connector, do not pull on the wire itself. To test the element, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch each probe to a terminal. Your reading should be somewhere between zero and infinity, refer to your owner\u2019s manual to determine what reading you should receive for your model. If it is exactly zero or infinity it is defective. If your test produces a reading different from the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation, you will need a replacement heating element .\n\n",
